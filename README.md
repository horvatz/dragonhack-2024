# Fashion clothing assistant (Dragonhack 2024 project)

App acts as a virtual fashion assistant, designed to provide friendly and personalized style advice. Users can upload an image of their outfit, and the assistant will rate it, offering feedback on style, color coordination, and fit. It also allows users to request outfit recommendations, which are tailored to enhance their individual style. The interaction pattern is simple: rate the outfit, provide feedback, and, if requested, suggest a new lookâ€”all with the feel of chatting with a close friend.
